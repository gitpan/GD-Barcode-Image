Revision history for Perl extension GD::Barcode::Image

1.03  2007-08-26
        - more doc cleanup
        - put the --man test in a TODO block. That test works when run
          in local working directory, but it fails when running as root
          and installing the same package from CPAN. So, until I figure this
          out, moving the --man test into a TODO block.
